# VR-Project

To test the prototype go to "ProjectSetup" scene. 
Deactivate the "XR Device Simulator" for testing with headset.

You can move with left joystick, teleport to certain sufaces with right joystick.
There is a sphere you can interact and the "Dog" prefab looks at. If you put it close enough, white particles appear. 
If you pet the dog with your left controller, red particles appear.
